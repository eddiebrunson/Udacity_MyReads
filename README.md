# Udacity MyReads Project 1

This is my project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, which is apart of [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). The Goal of this project was to create a React application that utilizes React Components to the manage user interface. The application is basically a online bookself where books are catagorized as the follow:
